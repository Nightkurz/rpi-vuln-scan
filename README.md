Docker container with automated OpenVAS 10 (GVMD 9) based on the Debian 10 image.

It contains custom automation script that allows to scan selected targets and generate a report with one command.

This is a lite version and it does not include Greenbone Security Assistant - web app for managing OpenVAS.

Older container based on Ubuntu with OpenVAS 9 is available [here](https://github.com/TheDoctor0/openvas-docker-lite/tree/9).

## Usage

### 1. Pull image:

```
docker pull thedoctor0/openvas-docker-lite:10
```

### 2. Scan and save report:

```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/reports/:rw thedoctor0/openvas-docker-lite python3 -u scan.py <target> [options]
```

This will start up the container and update the NVTs cache - it can take some time, so be patient.

After that, the scan script will run and the progress will be displayed in the console.

#### Output

It is possible to specify output filename with **-o** or **--output** argument.

By default report is saved as *openvas.report*.

#### Formats

1. Anonymous XML
2. ARF
3. CPE
4. CSV Hosts
5. CSV Results
6. ITG
7. LaTeX
8. NBE
9. PDF
10. Topology SVG
11. TXT
12. Verinice ISM
13. Verinice ITG
14. XML

You can select what report format will be used with **-f** or **--format** argument with one of the available profiles.

By default *ARF* format is used to generate the report.

#### Profiles

1. Discovery
2. Empty
3. Full and fast
4. Full and fast ultimate
5. Full and very deep
6. Full and very deep ultimate
7. Host Discovery
8. System Discovery

You can select scan profile by adding **-p** or **--profile** argument with one of the available profiles.

By default *Full and fast* profile is used.

#### Alive Tests

1. Scan Config Default
2. ICMP, TCP-ACK Service & ARP Ping
3. TCP-ACK Service & ARP Ping
4. ICMP & ARP Ping
5. ICMP & TCP-ACK Service Ping
6. ARP Ping
7. TCP-ACK Service Ping
8. TCP-SYN Service Ping
9. ICMP Ping
10. Consider Alive

You can select scan alive tests by adding **-t** or **--tests** argument with one of the available tests.

By default *ICMP, TCP-ACK Service & ARP Ping* alive tests are used.

#### Exclude Hosts

You can exclude hosts from specified target by adding **-e** or **--exclude** argument with list of IPs.

By default list of excluded hosts is empty.

#### Max Hosts

It is possible to override *max_hosts* variable in OpenVAS config which specify maximum number of simultaneous hosts tested.
Just add **-m** or **--max** argument with wanted numeric value.

By default **10** is used as *max_hosts* variable value.

#### Max Checks

It is possible to override *max_checks* variable in OpenVAS config which specify maximum number of simultaneous checks against each host tested.
Just add **-c** or **--checks** argument with wanted numeric value.

By default **3** is used as *max_checks* variable value.

#### Debug

You can enable printing command responses by adding **--debug** argument.

#### Update

You can also add **--update** argument to force update.

This will synchronize OpenVAS feeds before making the scan.

Feeds update is quite slow, so it will take significantly more time.
